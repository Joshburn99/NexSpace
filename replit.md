### Multi-Worker Shift System
- Shifts support multiple workers per shift (`requiredWorkers`, `assignedWorkerIds`)
- Staffing ratio calculations and availability checking
- Specialty-based worker matching and conflict detection
- Real-time status tracking and notifications

## User Preferences
- Focus on comprehensive, working solutions over partial implementations
- Prioritize TypeScript type safety and proper data modeling
- Maintain clean separation between mock data (development) and Firebase (production)
- Emphasize multi-worker shift scheduling capabilities
- Document architectural decisions with clear migration pathways

## Development Guidelines
- Use mock data during development phase before Firebase integration
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Maintain utility functions for complex business logic
- Follow the established service layer pattern for future Firebase integration
- Test multi-worker scenarios with realistic healthcare data

## Current Status
The platform now has a solid TypeScript foundation with comprehensive interfaces, mock data, and utility functions. Ready for component development using the established patterns before Firebase integration.
