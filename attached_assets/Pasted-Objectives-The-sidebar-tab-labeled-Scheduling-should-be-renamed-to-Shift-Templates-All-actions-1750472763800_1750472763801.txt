Objectives:

The sidebar tab labeled "Scheduling" should be renamed to Shift Templates.

All actions (create, edit, delete, activate/inactivate) in the Shift Templates view should be fully functional.

Shift templates should dynamically control the open shifts posted to each connected facility schedule based on template needs.

Facility scheduling UI for coordinators (DONs, Schedulers, etc.) should be upgraded to match leading apps (see OnShift screenshot for reference).

🟦 Shift Templates Tab
Rename sidebar label from "Scheduling" to Shift Templates.

Display a table of all templates with columns: Template Name, Department, Specialty, Time, Staff Range, Status, Actions (Edit/Delete).

Actions should function: Edit opens the template editor, Delete prompts confirmation and removes the template, Status toggles Active/Inactive.

Template logic: For each active template, automatically generate open shifts on the associated facility’s schedule (e.g. 4 ICU RN Day shifts for Portland General = 4 open shifts every day on their schedule).

Any edit to a template (quantity, time, specialty) should instantly update the corresponding open shifts for that facility across the platform.

🟩 Facility User Scheduling Page (Coordinator/DON)
Rebuild facility schedule page in the style of the provided OnShift screenshot:

Left: Staff names & roles

Top: Days of the week (with “Today” & 2-Week toggle, see reference)

Grid: Each cell shows shift assignments, open shifts, call-offs, etc. Use clear visual indicators for open, filled, requested, and call-off status.

Action Bar: Add Shift, Copy, Print, Post, Requests (just like the reference).

Show required staffing at the bottom (e.g. “Required Hrs,” “Budget Hrs”) and display any shortages or overages.

Enable quick actions: fill shift, message staff, or request call-off replacement with a single click.

Calendar should reflect all current and future open shifts as generated by the active templates for that facility.

🔄 Universal Data Sync & Source of Truth
All open, filled, requested, and historical shifts MUST be pulled from a single, centralized shift data source.

If a template is edited, all future shifts (except filled/closed) are updated platform-wide.

Shift status changes (requested, filled, cancelled) update immediately across:

Employee/contractor calendar views

Facility scheduling page

Shift requests and open shifts lists

Shift insights/history & analytics

When impersonating, all changes must update everywhere (e.g. profile edits, shift requests, time entries).

All history (including requests, fills, declines) should be logged and accessible as audit data.

🛠️ General Requirements
Remove any duplicate tabs (“Scheduling,” “Enhanced Calendar,” etc.) and make sure sidebar navigation is clean and direct.

All navigation links must take the user to their respective, functional views.

All platform widgets (open shifts, upcoming requests, etc.) should use this centralized shift data.

If you need placeholder data, generate realistic shifts, staff, and facilities matching normal census levels.

🎨 UI/UX
Use NexSpace branding (see logo) and a clean, modern, hospital-appropriate palette (blue/white, clear icons).

Responsive, easy to use on desktop and tablet.

Provide tooltips for all shift types and actions (ex: “Click to fill,” “Click to message,” etc.)

Maintain accessibility and ARIA best practices.

🔁 Test Cases
Creating/editing templates instantly changes posted open shifts for the connected facility.

Facility coordinators can visually manage daily/weekly staffing and react quickly to shortages.

All user roles only see data appropriate to them.

All actions and data are consistently reflected across the platform.

Please implement these changes, ensuring robust, live data flow and a modern, user-friendly scheduling experience for facility users.
