Staff Credentials & Compliance
Healthcare facilities must track compliance – such as staff credentials, trainings, and facility regulatory documents. The UI should reflect permissions around these areas:
View Compliance (view_compliance): Allows access to compliance dashboards or reports (apart from individual staff credentials). A user with view_compliance should be able to see compliance-related sections – for example, an overview of facility compliance status or a list of required documents and whether they’re up to date. In the UI, this might be a “Compliance” page showing things like overall training completion rates, pending document renewals, etc. For roles like HR Manager or Viewer who have this permission, make sure a Compliance or Regulatory section is visible (it could be under Insights/Analytics as “Compliance”
GitHub
 or a separate menu item).
Manage Compliance (manage_compliance): Allows taking action on compliance items – e.g., updating compliance records, scheduling trainings, marking documents as reviewed. In UI, if a user has this, they should see management controls on the compliance page:
e.g., an option to “mark compliance task as complete” or upload a new policy document, etc.
If they lack it, the compliance page (if they have view access) is read-only. For example, a Viewer can see compliance stats but not change anything; an HR Manager can both view and update compliance items.
Upload Documents (upload_documents): Typically tied to compliance and credential management – it allows the user to upload files (such as staff licenses, certification PDFs, or facility policy documents). Users with this permission (Facility Admin, HR Manager) should see “Upload” buttons in relevant places:
On a staff profile’s credentials section, an “Upload Document” button to attach a new credential file.
On the facility compliance page, an option to upload regulatory documents (for example, uploading a new procedure or policy file).
Without this permission, those upload buttons are hidden. Users who can view info but not upload (e.g., a Viewer or Scheduling Manager) will just see the list of documents or placeholders.
Facility Regulatory Documents: If your system tracks facility-level documents (policies, contracts, etc.), tie their visibility to these permissions too. For instance, a Facility Admin or Corporate role might upload documents, and a Viewer could only download/view them. Ensure there’s a UI section (perhaps under Facility Profile or Compliance) that lists these documents for those with at least view access.
