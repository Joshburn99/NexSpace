🚀 Replit AI Prompt: Fix Calendar 404s, Superuser Impersonation, and Advanced Filters

🛠️ Fix 404 Errors for Calendar/Scheduling Tabs
Make sure all sidebar links for Enhanced Calendar, Scheduling, and Advanced Scheduling route to existing, implemented pages.

If a page doesn’t exist, scaffold a new React page with a placeholder and basic layout, then link the sidebar button to that new page.

Remove or hide any sidebar items that are truly obsolete.

Every sidebar calendar/scheduling view should be reachable, not result in a 404.

🦸‍♂️ Superuser Impersonation
Allow the superuser to impersonate any user account on the platform, regardless of their type (facility user, employee, contractor, admin, etc).

In the impersonation modal/list, ensure all users appear with role, facility/team association, and a search filter.

When impersonating, all platform permissions and UI should reflect the impersonated user’s role.

Show a prominent "Quit" button at the top of every page while impersonating.

On "Quit", restore the original superuser session.

🔍 Calendar View Filters
For every calendar or scheduling view, add filters for:

Facility Name (multi-select dropdown)

Facility Team (multi-select or search)

Worker Name (searchable dropdown)

Specialty (dropdown)

Status (dropdown: open, requested, confirmed, cancelled, filled, etc.)

Filters must be fully functional. For example, when a facility is selected, show only the shifts at that facility; selecting a worker shows only their shifts.

All filtered data should update in real time, using the centralized shift data store.

Filters should stack (ex: filter by both facility and specialty at once).

🏥 Universal Data Source & Permissions
All calendar, scheduling, and shift views should draw from a single, centralized shift source of truth.

When data changes (like filtering, editing, assigning, etc.), the change should be instantly reflected everywhere relevant.

Each user role only sees the data and actions they’re permitted to, whether in normal or impersonation mode.

Reference:

See screenshots for your current UI and for inspiration.

Please:

Fix all 404 errors for sidebar calendar/scheduling tabs.

Implement advanced, real-time filters on all scheduling views.

Ensure superuser can impersonate any user with correct permissions and easy “Quit” button.

Sync all data to a universal source of truth for accuracy across the platform.
