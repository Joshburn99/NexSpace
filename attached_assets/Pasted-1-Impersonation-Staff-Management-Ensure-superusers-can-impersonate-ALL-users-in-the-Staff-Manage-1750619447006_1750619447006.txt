1️⃣ Impersonation & Staff Management
Ensure superusers can impersonate ALL users in the Staff Management section—including Sarah Johnson and all current/future workers.

Remove superusers (Josh Burnett, Brian Nangle, etc.) from the All Staff section, so only real workers and facility users show up.

Sync facility association:

Each worker must be associated with one or more facilities.

Add this association to their profile (visible to superusers in Staff Management).

Confirm that when a superuser impersonates a user, they have the same permissions and navigation as that user would see.

2️⃣ Navigation & Access
On worker UI, remove the Enhanced Calendar and make sure Open Shifts tab is a list view—showing only:

Shifts that are open/requested, not assigned

Only shifts that match the worker’s specialty and facilities

Make sure workers cannot see:

Enhanced Calendar

Advanced Scheduling

Facility/Team management screens

All schedule/calendar tabs should have robust filters:

Filter by facility name, facility team, worker name, specialty, and status

Filters must function on all relevant calendar/list views

3️⃣ UI & Status Improvements
On Enhanced Calendar view:

Entire shift block color should match the status (not just the corner icon)

Status icon should be in the top right of each shift

Add more status types:

NCNS (No Call, No Show)

Pending Invoice Review

Completed

Any others necessary for healthcare workflows

Ensure status logic:

Past shifts: cannot be requested, cannot be posted by facility users, cannot show as open

Future shifts: can’t show statuses like NCNS, Cancelled, or Pending Invoice Review unless triggered by actual workflow events

4️⃣ Scheduling & Templates
“Shift Templates” should be a dedicated tab, not a scheduling view

Shift Templates control the facility schedules:

If Portland General Hospital has an ICU Day Shift template for 4 RNs, show 4 open shifts each day on the Portland General schedule

Use OnShift-style interface for facility users (see attached screenshot) for scheduling grid & shift management

5️⃣ Professional Invoices / Timesheets Logic
Clock in button should:

Only be available within a 15-min window before shift start

Not available if not scheduled for a shift at that time

Clock out should:

Prompt submission of Professional Invoice (contractors) or Timesheet (employees)

Route submission to the facility user

Auto-approve if all criteria met (per facility’s workflow automation); otherwise, require manual approval

Shifts and invoice/timesheet data should flow to “My Schedule” (worker view) and be accessible for both employees and contractors, labeled accordingly

No worker should be able to see other workers’ timesheets/invoices

6️⃣ Data Source of Truth & Syncing
Audit and refactor all data flows so all pages, lists, and widgets use a centralized source of truth (ideally, the “shifts” collection/table in the DB)

All “schedule,” “my schedule,” “open shifts,” “staff management,” “insights,” and related pages must reflect the same up-to-date data

All workers shown on shifts must appear in All Staff, and all workers in All Staff should be assignable/request shifts

Build out enough sample worker profiles so the platform is realistically populated for testing and demo

7️⃣ Advanced Scheduling Logic
Do not allow shifts in the past to be requested or posted

Apply additional scheduling logic as needed (e.g., no double-booking workers, no over-scheduling, compliance checks)

Add logic and flow for professional invoices and timesheets as above

8️⃣ General Improvements
Fix 404 errors for Enhanced Calendar, Scheduling, Advanced Scheduling

All data changes (profile updates, schedule requests, messages) should immediately sync across the platform, and persist for impersonated/superuser sessions

Feel free to suggest further workflow improvements as you see gaps!
