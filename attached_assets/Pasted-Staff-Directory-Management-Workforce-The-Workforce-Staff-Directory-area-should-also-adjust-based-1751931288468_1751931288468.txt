Staff Directory & Management (Workforce)
The Workforce/Staff Directory area should also adjust based on permissions related to staff management:
View Staff (view_staff): Baseline to access the Staff Directory (list of all staff members at the facility). Only roles with view_staff should see the Workforce or Staff menu and page. In practice, all roles except Billing Manager have this, so most facility users will have a Staff Directory. For those who don’t (e.g. Billing Manager), hide the “All Staff” section entirely. Currently, the sidebar shows “Workforce” for all facility managers

 – this should be restricted so that if a user lacks view_staff, that menu is omitted.
Create Staff (create_staff): Controls the ability to add/invite new staff. In the UI, show an “Add Staff” button (or “Invite Staff”) only if the user has this permission. For example, an HR Manager or Facility Admin should see a button on the Staff Directory page to add new staff members. Scheduling Managers, Department Heads, etc., who lack create_staff will not see this button. Ensure the form or modal for adding staff is also gated – users without permission shouldn’t be able to manually navigate to it.
Edit Staff (edit_staff): Controls editing existing staff profiles. If the user has this permission, they can see an “Edit” option on a staff member’s profile page (or an inline edit capability in the directory). This could be an “Edit Profile” button or making fields editable. Without edit_staff, staff details pages should be read-only (no editable fields or save buttons). For roles like Scheduling Manager or Department Head (who have view_staff but not edit), they can view staff info but not modify things like names, roles, etc.
Deactivate Staff (deactivate_staff): Allows disabling or reactivating a staff member’s account/employment status. Only Facility Admins (and possibly HR Managers if needed) have this. In the UI, if a user has this permission, provide a control to deactivate/activate staff (for example, a toggle switch on the profile or a “Deactivate” button). This might appear next to a staff member’s status or in an actions menu. Users without this permission simply won’t see that control. (Be sure to also enforce this in backend – e.g., only authorized roles can call the deactivate API.)
View Staff Credentials (view_staff_credentials): Allows viewing detailed credential information for staff (licenses, certifications, etc.). If a user has this, the staff profile should include a section for Credentials/Certifications and their status (and possibly expiration dates). Also, a dedicated “Credentials” page (as listed under Workforce in the menu
GitHub
) can be shown to aggregate credential info across staff – but only to those with credential view permission. For example, an HR Manager or Facility Admin would use this to see which staff have expiring licenses, while a Scheduling Manager (who doesn’t have this permission) might not need that page visible.
Manage Staff Credentials (manage_staff_credentials): Allows updating or verifying credentials. Users with this permission (HR Manager, Facility Admin) can do actions like approving a uploaded license, marking a certification as verified, or adding a new credential record to a staff member. In UI, when this permission is present, provide “Manage” capabilities on the Credentials page or staff profile:
e.g., an “Upload Credential” button or “Verify” checkbox for each credential.
Without it, those actions are hidden or disabled – the user can only read the credentials. (Viewers might have view_staff_credentials via compliance view, but not manage.)
Staff Directory UI considerations: Take inspiration from HR systems:
Include search and filters (by department, specialty, status) in the staff list to help managers find employees.
Display key info like each staff’s role, status (active/on leave), and perhaps next shift or availability if relevant.
If the user can manage staff, provide bulk actions or quick links (like “send message to staff” if a messaging system exists).
Ensure that for roles who only have view access, none of the management UI components appear. For instance, a Viewer will see the list of staff and their details, but no edit, add, or manage buttons at all.
