1. Critical Goal:
The Add Shift popup still fails with “Invalid shift data” even after recent fixes.
I need to know the exact validation error and have the issue fully resolved so I can create shifts.

2. Requirements & Constraints:

Title field is not needed for shift creation. Remove from all validation.

I must be able to select multiple dates and create one shift per date, with each shift properly created in the database.

All required backend fields (facility, department, specialty, start/end time, rate, required staff, urgency, description, etc.) must be present and valid in the payload.

3. What’s Not Working:

I still get the same “Invalid shift data” error, and server logs aren’t surfacing which field is failing.

The current debugging does not show a detailed field-level error in the logs.

Sometimes the request might not even reach the intended backend endpoint, or there is a schema mismatch or missing field/type issue.

The UI experience for selecting multiple dates is now improved but shift creation is still failing.

4. What You Need to Do:

a) Enhance backend logging:

Log the entire incoming shift creation payload and each field’s type/validation step.

Log the exact field and reason for any failure (“Expected number, got string”; “Missing required: specialty”; etc.).

If the request isn’t reaching the backend at all, log that and explain why.

b) Explicit validation:

For each required field, log whether it is present, non-empty, and valid.

Remove the title requirement entirely if present in the validation schema.

c) Show an exact, user-facing error message in the frontend (not just “Invalid shift data”), e.g.:

“Missing required field: facility”

“Invalid rate: must be a number”

“Specialty is required”

d) Allow shift creation for multiple days.

Creating shifts for multiple selected dates should result in multiple shifts—one per day—each fully validated and created.

Ensure the UI and backend agree on the schema and all required fields.

5. Debug Example:
If the error persists, respond with:

The exact backend logs showing the received payload.

The result of schema validation (field-by-field).

The field and error causing the failure.

6. Finalize:

Once the field-level bug is found, fix the form/frontend/backend so valid shifts can be created, and update the validation to prevent this in the future.

Confirm shift creation is working with a test shift.

Summary:

Remove all title requirements for shift creation.

Show field-level validation errors.

Enable smooth, error-free creation of one shift per selected date.

Provide full debugging if anything fails.
